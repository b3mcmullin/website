	<h1>Special Characters</h1>

	<p> Since &lt;, &gt; and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead,you need to use the so called "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use & l t ; to reprepresent it.</p>
