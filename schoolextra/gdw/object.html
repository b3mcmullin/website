	<br> You are the great terminal

	<p>In terms of the object element &lt;br&gt; this is the same thing as hitting enter on a keyboard.  The object element &alt;hr&gt; draws a horizontal line on the page.</p>

	<p>Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline<br>
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights<br>
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours<br>
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers<br>
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight<br><br>
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey, momma rock me<br>
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey, momma rock me<br><br>
I'm running from the cold up in New England<br>
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band<br>
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now<br>
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down<br>
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town<br>
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more<br><br>
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey, momma rock me<br>
Hey, rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey, momma rock me<br><br>
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke<br>
Caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke<br>
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap<br>
To Johnson City, Tennessee<br>
And I gotta get a move on before the sun<br>
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one<br>
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free<br><br>So rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey, momma rock me<br>
Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey momma rock me<br><br> Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel<br>
Rock me momma any way you feel<br>
Hey, momma rock me (mama rock me, mama rock me)<br>
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain<br>
Rock me momma like a south bound train<br>
Hey, ey yeah momma rock me (you can rock me, rock me)<br>
