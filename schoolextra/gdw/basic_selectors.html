  <h1>Basic CSS Selectors</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt id="j">Element Selectors</dt><dd>Element Selectors are the most basic selectors and are quite simple.  These style a specific type of element.  An example of this is h3 {  background-color: #FFF;  }  which makes all h3s have a background color of white.  So the syntax is just element to style  {   put css here }. </dd>
    <dt>Class Selectors</dt><dd>Class selectors allow one to be more precise which specific elements to style and also allows for multiple elements to be styled in the same way.  The syntax for these is to have html element(s) like &lt;ol class="j"&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; and &lt;p class="j"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; and then have css like so:  .j {  css here  }  which would style both the &lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; and &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; elements in the same way </dd>
    <dt id="l">ID Selectors</dt><dd>Id Selectors allow for one to style specific elements that have ids (ex. &lt;li id="apple"&gt;&lt;/li&gt; would have id of "apple") and these selectors will show over class selectors if they conflict.  An example of this is if we use the &lt;li id="apple"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;id selector then one could style it by writing #apple { css content here } to style that element and any others with an id selector of apple. </dd>
    <dt>Group Selectors</dt><dd>Group Selectors are selectors that allow one to style multiple different elements in the same way.  The syntax for this is to list the first element being style then comma, space the next element and so on.  For example, if I did h1, h2 { text-align: center;  }  then both h1s and h2s would be centered. </dd>
    <dt id="k">Pseudo-class Selectors for Hyperlink Elements</dt><dd>These are specific selectors for Hyperlinks which can style links when they have not been clicked on, when they have, when you are clicking on them and when you hover on them.  The syntax for these class selectors is a:whatever the specific thing about the link you are styling.  For example, if you wanted to style links before you clicked on them you would use the class selector a:link { css content }. </dd>
