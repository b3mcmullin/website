    <h2>Look how easy it is to write Java Script</h2>
    <p>You don't know JavaScript yet, but we bet you can make some good guesses about how JavaScript code works.  Take a look at each line of code below and see if you can guess what it does.  Write in your answers below.  We've done one for you to get you started.  If you get stuck, the answers are on the next page.</p>
    <h3>This is a few lines of my guessing answers</h3>
    <table class="a">
      <tr><td class="b">var price = 28.99;</td><td>Create a variable named price, and assign the value 28.99 to it.</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="b"> var discount = 10;</td><td>Create a variable called discount and set it equal to 10 </td></tr>
      <tr><td class="b">var total = </td><td>create a variable called total and set it equal to the value of ... </td></tr>
      <tr><td class="b">price - (price * (discount / 100));</td><td> to the value of the price variable minus the value of the price variable times the value of the discount variable divided by 100. </td></tr>
      <tr><td class="b">if (total > 25) {</td><td>means if value of the variable total is greater than 25 ... </td></tr>
      <tr><td class="b">freeShipping(); </td><td>then run something called freeShipping? </td></tr>
      <tr><td class="b"> } </td><td>end of the if variable with a } </td></tr>
